# The Stirling Engine
The Stirling Engine is the processing tool for Keeping History. It provides media conversion and compression, data analysis, metadata enhancement, stream packaging and archival, and is extensible through plugins.

## About
The Stirling Engine is meant to be a lightweight, efficient way to process incoming media files. The engine's main responsibilties are to:
- Normalize uploaded media
- Extract data from the media
- Re-encode the media using modern, stream-ready standards
- Analyze extracted data for additional data enhancements
- Package media and metadata in a standard, open format

## Getting Started

### Requirements/Prerequisites

### Installation

### Your first conversion

### Testing your conversion

## Next steps

## Goals
The goals of the Stirling Engine are to:
- Store open-source encoded media with long-lived compatibility
- Provide access to a wealth of metadata from media without any client-side processing
- Make multimedia accessible to all by providing additional context
- Relieve the pain of media processing for archivists, historians and teachers
- Make it extensible and a community-led project
