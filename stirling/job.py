class StirlingJob(StirlingClass):
    """A collection of arguments, plugins, and commands to process on a source file.

    A StirlingJob contains the base arguments, functions and information
    necessary to start up a Stirling job. These include things like
    input and output file and directories, and other options related to the
    running of the job.


    Attributes:
        source (str): The input source filename (required)
        id (uuid.UUID): The unique ID of the job. We create a random UUID v4
            whenever a job is created, however a custom one can be supplied so
            long as it is a UUID v4.
        time_start (datetime.datetime): The start time of the job in UTC.
        time_end (datetime.datetime): The end time of the job in UTC.
        duration (float): the length of the job run time, in seconds.
        media_info (core.StirlingMediaInfo): Contains metadata about the
            source media file, after it is probed.
        plugins (list): A list of plugins to run on the source file. To attach
            Plugins to the job, use the add_plugins() method.
        commands (list): A list of commands to run on the source file.
            When a plugin generates a Command, it is also responsible for adding
            each file (or a directory) that it expects to be generated by that
            command for that plugin.
        outputs (list): Once all commands are run and the
            job is ready to be closed, the actual output from each of the commands
            will be checked against the expected outputs (here) to ensure that al
            of the expected files were generated and the commands ran successfully.
            Note: A job will not fail if there are missing or extra files generated,
            but it should be noted to the user that a plugin or command may have
            failed.
        framework (core.StirlingMediaFramework): The framework to use to process media
            files. Defaults to FFMpeg.

        config (Namespace): A Namespace object containing the configuration for the
            job. This is created from the StirlingConfig object, and is passed to
            the framework when the job is created. Variables include:

            job_file (pathlib.Path | str): A JSON document describing the job. This
                file is created when the job is created, and updated as the job
                progresses. Alternately, a job can be created from a JSON file
                passed in as this argument. Strings will be interpreted into a
                Path; if no root path is given then the current The default is None, which will cause
                a file named 'job.json' to be created in the output directory.
            log_file (pathlib.Path | str): The filename to output logs from the job.
            input_directory (pathlib.Path): The folder prefix where incoming files
                are located. Defaults to the current working directory
            source_delete (bool): Delete the temporary incoming source file
                when finished. By default, the temporary incoming source file is not
                deleted.
            output_directory (pathlib.Path | str): The directory to output the package.
                Defaults to a folder named with the job's ID (a random UUID) in the
                current working folder.
            output_annotations_directory (pathlib.Path | str): The directory prefix to use when
                storing annotations. Defaults to `annotations`.

                media file as it was uploaded is created in the output directory
                as "source". This can be disabled.
